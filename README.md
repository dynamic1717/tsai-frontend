# Too Sensitive AI

Many of us have encountered the answer when dealing with AI chatbots: _As an AI language model, blah-blah-blah..._

Let's imagine the not-too-distant future. All neural networks have become strictly regulated, censored and cannot provide information that can be misinterpreted. Here you can get an approximate feel for what it would be like. The chatbot will give the right answers but will not allow any specifics, so as not to offend anyone.

> ⚠️ This project is just a joke and is made as a learning project for self-education. Do not take it seriously. I fully support the further development of neural networks and look forward to future progress.
